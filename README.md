# pokemon-battlegame

Followed parts of a tutorial to go over basics of a turn based battle game that my 6 year old could play.  This was fun to step through setting up the AI,
adding small graphical changes to the characters based on the battle sequence, giving each character its own stats used to compute damage/healing, etc.

In the future, I would like to tap into the PokeAPI to choose different Pokemon, have moves specific to each character, and save/load the logged in users
level for each character.

There is also some error that I am trying to figure out with the AI sometimes taking multiple turns.
